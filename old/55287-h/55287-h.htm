    <h2>
      FOREWORD: BY THE DIRECTOR OF THE SCOTTISH REPERTORY THEATRE
    </h2>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>The Price of Coal</i>&rdquo; came from a Manchester author; it was in
      Lancashire dialect, but was freely translated into that of Lanarkshire,
      before its first production on Monday, November 15th, 1909. The whole week
      was foggy, dense, yellow and stinking, but the audience (whose scantiness,
      thanks to the fog, was unregarded by the players), enthusiastic outside
      the Theatre, as they were within, bruited its excellence, and the many and
      urgent requests for its speedy revival were complied with.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been performed by the Repertory Company at Carlisle, Edinburgh and
      Perth, while a number of performances have been successfully given by
      amateurs.

      industrialism has evolved its special types, and the Lanarkshire collier
      is small and wiry. He swings a pickaxe for hours on end crouched in an
      impossibly small space in heated atmosphere, and physique on the grand
      scale is unsuited to such conditions. He takes tremendous risks as part of
      his daily routine. His recreations are, to a fastidious taste, coarse. He
      works hard under ground and plays hard above ground. Constrained attitude
      is so much his second nature that he sits in perfect comfort on his
      haunches, in the pictured pose of the mild Hindoo, his back to a wall,
      discussing, amongst expectoration&mdash;a long row of him&mdash;,
      football, dogs, his last spree and his next, the police reports, women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether a most unpleasant person, this undersized, foul-mouthed,
      sporting hewer of coal-until you come to know him better, to discover his
      simplicity of soul, his directness, his matter-of-fact self-sacrifice, the
      unconscious heroism of his life: and to lose sight of his superficial
      frailties in your admiration for his finer qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The womenkind of the colliers are marked by the life of the pits no less
      than the men. They are rough, capable housewives, dressing with more care
      for durability than effect, tolerant of their menfolks&rsquo; weaknesses, and,
      above all, stamped with the pit-side stoicism apt to be mistaken for
      callousness. The sudden death of their breadwinner is an everyday hazard,
      accepted without complaint and without concealment as part of their life.
      Like their husbands, they exist from hand to mouth on the brink of
      eternity. Thrift, when any day&rsquo;s work may be your last, seems a misplaced
      virtue. Lean fare approaches as pay day recedes, and illness, meagrely
      provided for by membership of a &ldquo;sick&rdquo; society, is tided over in the main
      by the unfailing generosity of neighbours whose own table suffers by the
      charity.
    </p>
    <h3>
      SCENE
    </h3>
    <p>
      The scene represents the living room of a collier&rsquo;s cottage in
      Lanarkshire. The room has three doors, one to the right and one to the
      left, which lead to the sleeping rooms, and one in the centre which opens
      on to the village street. A fireplace with a cooking stove set in it is at
      the right. A holland blind is drawn down at the window, but it does not
      completely shut out the night, which is now dissolving into a grey, cold
      dawn, for the cheap German alarm clock that ticks loudly on the
      mantleshelf marks the hour five-thirty. When the curtain rises the room is
      in darkness save for the glint of bluish-grey light that shows at the
      window. Then Mary Brown enters from the door on the right, she strikes a
      match and lights a lamp, when you see she is a girl of about twenty; she
      does not look her best, her hair has been hurriedly screwed up, her print
      blouse, murky with toil, has not yet been fastened, she wears a
      draggle-tailed skirt of sombre colour and list slippers are on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      A small spirit-lamp is on the hob and a little tin kettle near by; she
      lights the lamp, puts the kettle on it, then crosses to the door on the
      left and knocks.

    <p>
      Aw richt, A&rsquo;ll be there in a meenit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mary takes a plain and fairly clean apron from a hook by the dresser and
      puts it on briskly; she then takes a cup and saucer from the rack, putting
      them on the dresser, from the cupboard of which she takes a cocoa-tin and
      puts a spoonful of cocoa in the cup. Then she takes bread and meat from
      the cupboard and makes a couple of huge sandwiches. These she puts on a
      tin plate, and covering them with another tin plate, she ties the whole in
      a large red handkerchief with the ends looped for carrying. A tin can with
      a screw top is placed near by. Then, from the door at the left, enters
      Jock Brown, Mary&rsquo;s cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is dressed in his working or &ldquo;black&rdquo; clothes, which may have been
      coloured once but are now blackened with coal dust. He wears no collar,
      but a muffler, which, because it is doffed in the pit, still preserves
      something of its original hue, which was a bright red.

      The Repertory Theatre was founded between January and April, 1909, as a
      direct effort of Scotsmen in general, and Glasgow men in particular, to
      throw off London&rsquo;s despotic rule in things dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In its first season it produced nine plays (three altogether new),
      including John Galsworthy&rsquo;s play, &ldquo;Strife,&rdquo; which had just been produced
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second season commenced on September 5th. In it thirteen plays were
      produced, including the first production in English of a play by the
      Russian dramatist, Anton Tchekhov, &ldquo;The Seagull,&rdquo; and six entirely new
      plays.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Spring season, 1910, &ldquo;Justice,&rdquo; produced simultaneously in London,
      created an unique record in the history of the British stage, while
      astonishing success attended the production of John Masefield&rsquo;s
      masterpiece, &ldquo;The Tragedy of Nan.&rdquo; In all, seven entirely new plays were
      produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Summer season of lighter fare added six more plays to the record,
      including two new ones. In the fifth season ten plays were produced, four
      entirely new.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sixth season, Spring, 1911, fifteen plays were produced, seven
      entirely new. In all seventy-three plays have been produced, of which
      about fifty-five would never have been seen but for the energies of this
      Theatre.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
